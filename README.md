All features have been scaled between 0-1 for the following datasets. Each dataset alternates between malicious (m) and benign (b) samples

dataset_a: 1000 b, 250 m
dataset_b: 1500 b, 150 m
dataset_c: 500 b, 100 m

So they simulate b samples, followed by m samples, followed by b samples, etc...
